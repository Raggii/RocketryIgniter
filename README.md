# RocketryIgniter
To design and prototype a dual ignition system that can receive commands over UART and CANBUS. The device must be able to receive commands that arm and fire two separate but identical ignition circuits while also outputting its own system status. The design must attempt to be as compact as possible while also allowing for easy debugging.
